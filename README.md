# Welcome to my GitHub profile

I'm a software engineer with a passion for learning and exploring new technologies. I'm currently working on several projects to improve my skills and knowledge. I'm also sometimes involved in open source projects.

I also like to work as a freelancer, so if you have a project you need help with, I'm here to help you. I'm always open to new opportunities and challenges, so don't hesitate to contact me.
